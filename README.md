# Prototype-3-Fixed-Upload

Prototype Hypothesis:

I want to watch players adapt to using a drift-centric driving style to navigate a course as fast as possible, improving their personal best time and experiencing "clutch" moments of gameplay. 
I hope to discover the strengths and weakenesses of my prototype. 
I want to know how players feel about the mechanics of the car and the speed.


PLAYTEST RESULTS

Through playtests, I received a lot fo valuable feedback. 

Firstly, it's worth noting that the driving mechanics like top speed and grip on the road are overtuned and most found it initially hard to get a grasp of.
After playing a bitm they get the jist of the controls. I'm thinking that perhaps a training area before the race could be of benefit. 
The general thought process to use arrow keys and/or WASD to move was understood by most testers but a controls screen was suggested regardless. 
Multiple players also suggested other players, CPU opponents or ghost car to race VS. They know it to be a racing game but there's nothign to race. 
One player became obsessed with improving their time and enjoyed the idea of competing for the best time.
They suggest a leaderboard where you can see your name and your time for each race. 
Some players desired additional driving features and objectives.
Perhaps hitting SPACE would use boost to go faster, moving the mouse to look around, having a special ability (cannon? boosters? Wings?), shortcuts integrated into the track, etc. 

One player suggested I use a controller so I can have a more realistic throttle control (I like this idea a lot!)

Frame skipping occurring at set places in the map, a problem to look into..

The overall experience players had was positive, they had fun, even if it was because they were laughing at their driving skills. I feel like the goofy driving mechanics 
will enable a lot of funny situations but at the same time, mastering it and getting a few clean turns one after another is a great way to provide some sense of satisfaction. 

Only one player mentioned the music.

Only a couple players mentioned the braking and how it feels weird but the visuals for it are good. 

One player mentioned enjoying the aesthetic of the level (low poly)
